# Right Now

Hi there. <a href="http://charliepark.org/">Charlie Park</a> here.

Maybe, like me, you start on a multi-step project, then get distracted, then forget what you were working on, and then have a hard time ramping back into it.

If so, you might find this helpful.

**Right Now is simply a temporary text file in a browser tab where you can jot down the thing you're working on right now.**

Using Right Now, when I lose focus, it's trivial to switch over and see what I had been working on. Depending on the number of open tabs you have, you might not even need to tab over, as the &lt;title> element duplicates the content of the window, so you can just glance at the tab bar and get a quick reminder of the task at hand.

You certainly don't need to load it on your own server, but you're more than welcome to. You can also just use the publicly-accessible version of it, at http://charliepark.org/rightnow/. Closing your browser tab/window will lose the text you've entered. It's for temporary things.

It uses an embedded font-face (Miso, made by <a href="http://omkrets.se/typografi/">MÃ¥rten Nettelbladt</a>), provided by <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/">FontSquirrel</a>. You can <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Miso">download Miso for free</a>. Frankly, Right Now looks better when you have Miso on your computer.

Now get back to work!
